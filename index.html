                With the wind in your face
                It feels good to be proud
                And be free and a race that is part of a clan
                To live on highlands
                With the air that you breathe
                So pure and so clean
            </p>
            <p>When alone on the hills
                With the wind in your hair
                With a longing to feel
                Just to be free
            </p>
            <p>Is it right to believe
                In the need to be free
                It's a time when you die
                And without asking why
                Can't you see what they do
                They are grinding us down
                They are taking our land
                That belongs to the clans0
            </p>
            <p>Not alone with a dream
                Just a want to be free
                With a need to belong
                I am a clansman
            </p>
            <p>Freedom
                Freedom
                Freedom
                Freedom
            </p>
            <p>It's a time wrought with fear
                It's a land wrought with change
                Ancestors could hear what is happening now
                They would turn in their graves
                They would all be ashamed
                That the land of the free has written in chains
            </p>
            <p>And I know what I want
                When the timing is right
                Then I'll take what is mine
                I am the clansman
            </p>
            <p>And I swear to defend
                I will fight to the end
                And I swear that I'll never be taken alive
                And I know that we'll stand
                We'll fight for a land
                And I swear that my bairns
                Will be born free
            </p>
            <p>And I know what I want
                When the timing is right
                Then I'll take what I want
                I am the clansman
            </p>
            <p>No, no we can't let them take anymore
                No we can't let them take anymore
                We're the land of the free
            </p>
            <p>Is it right to believe
